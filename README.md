# **Task Mate**

Task Mate is a todo app designed to help you manage your work and personal tasks efficiently. The app allows you to filter tasks based on categories and includes a notes feature for additional information. Task persistence is handled using local storage, ensuring that your tasks remain intact even after refreshing the page.

## **Features**

- **Task Management**: Create and delete tasks with ease.
- **Task Filtering**: Filter tasks by "Work" and "Personal" categories.
- **Notes**: Add notes to tasks to keep track of important details.
- **Local Storage**: All tasks and notes are stored locally in the browser, so they persist across sessions.
- **User Interface**: Simple and clean UI built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- **Navigation**: React Router DOM is used for seamless navigation between pages.
- **Authentication Pages**: Sign-up and log-in pages are created (functionality not yet implemented).

## **Technologies Used**

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **React Router DOM**: For routing and navigation within the app.
- **Local Storage**: Used to store tasks and notes persistently.

## **Future Enhancements**

- Implement user authentication for sign-up and log-in pages.
- Add task prioritization feature.
- Integrate a reminder/notification system.
- Sync tasks across devices using cloud storage.
- Enhance UI with more customizable themes.
